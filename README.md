# U.S.-States-Finder
Here in this Project we use Pandas and Turtle to read and locate states on particular coordinates


  <> First we find coordinates of state on turtle screen with the help of image which we install on screen (screenonclick()) this is the method.
  
  <> After getting all coordinates we setup all other things like running while loop, asking user for input(like states) and set x and y position of that input on screen.
  
  <> We also setup a quit function where all states automatical drawn onto their position, if user do not want to play
